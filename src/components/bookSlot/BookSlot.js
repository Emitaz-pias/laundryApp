            If you do your laundry yourself at home, you have to pay for all of
            the necessary supplies and associated costs, like electricity for
            the washing machine and lights, water, detergent, fabric softener,
            and the two most unaccounted resources â€“ the effort you used and the
            time you spent! Over time, these costs can add up. However, when you
            use a laundry service, these costs are included in the price. So,
            you can save money by using a laundry service instead of doing your
            laundry yourself at home.
